      <h1 class="w3-center">About Talushima</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">Hi, I’m Talmie and I’m a True Health Revivalist.</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">I help people lose weight, restore their digestion, restore their overall health, and boost their immune system through the Talushima BioCleanse Detox Program.  
I established Talushima, a private holistic health practice in 1995 and since then, I have worked with thousands of people from all over the world and all walks of life to take charge of their health.
Over the years, I developed the Talushima BioCleanse Detox Program which helps achieve a healthy body.  As clients saw results, they sent their friends and my business grew. 
Today, Talushima Holistic Health Retreat is a leader in deep and thorough cleansing that is yet very gentle on the body.  We provide lifestyle cleansing programs with our core value, using natural health therapies, healthier eating, whole, unprocessed, mostly plant-based foods and life coaching, to help you to achieve a healthy transformation. 
</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Depending on your circumstances, the Talushima BioCleanse Detox Program may vary from 3 weeks to 12 weeks with promising results of many incredible transformations. 
Beginning with a very gentle phase, the Talushima BioCleanse Detox Program progresses to the deep phase with every organ being cleansed and renewed, thus restoring normal flow in the body organs.

      <h2>Why a Detox Program?</h2>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">An examine of our earth reveals it to be made up of 70% water with beautiful rivers, oceans, and lakes.  Without their FLOW, stagnation would take over and life on earth would cease.
Like our earth, our bodies are made up of 70% water with organs and vessels that must maintain a healthy flow in order for the body to remain in a state of health.
However, our modern lifestyles constantly which constantly exposes us to air, water, and that are bombarded with pesticides, viruses, parasites, chemicals, synthetics, heavy metals and petroleum products we have come to trust.  These along with other factors slow down the body’s healthy flow while creating a health challenging environment resulting in  Low Flow / Low Health!
</p><br>
    <h2>Problems of Modern Lifestyle & Diets</h2>
      <h4>Processed and over-cooked, genetically engineered, fast, and junk foods:</h4>

          <li>Impair normal metabolic filtration processes of the intestines, liver, kidneys, lymph and lungs from filtering and removing toxic substances resulting in the body organs and channels to start to become fatigued prematurely aging, producing ailments such as allergies, skin conditions, migraines, digestive problems, constipation, weight issues, pain, etc.</li>
        </ul>
